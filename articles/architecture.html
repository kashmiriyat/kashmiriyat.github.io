      <h1>The syncretic roots of kashmiri architecture</h1>
      The kashmiri architechture is an amalgum of various styles. The Buddhist
      rule which commenced in the 3rd century AD set its mark on the stone
      architecture in the form of monasteries, stupas, etc.<br />
      From 4th to the 11th century, that is, during the period of medieval
      architecture, Hindu rule began and it promoted stone architecture, mainly
      in the form of temples.Later, Turkish rule (from the 14th to the
      16th-century) left its impressions on brick and wooden architecture
      (pinjirakari, hammam, etc), generally seen in shrines and mosques. The art
      of naqashi (painted lacquer) and khatamband (woodcraft in which wooden
      pieces are fitted into one another) was initiated by Persian and Central
      Asian craftsmen in Kashmir. The wooden and stone architecture (khatamband,
      pinjirakari) was also emphasised by the Mughal and Afghan rule. But not
      much architectural work was witnessed under Dogra rule.
      <br />
      Hence, it is palpable how numerous rules in Kashmir embellished its
      syncretic beauty. The robust edifices configured as shrines, temples,
      mosques, houses and houseboats illustrate the lambency of art and
      architecture in the valley.<br /><br />
