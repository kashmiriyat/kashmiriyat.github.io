      <h1>Hangul: The endangered musk of Kashmir</h1>
      Hangul (Moschus cupreus) is an endangered species of musk deer. These
      beautiful creatures stand at 60cm tall. The males have beautiful tusks,
      which are used by them in the mating season to compete for females. Under
      its belly, there are two small hairy glands, which produce small pellets
      of a black substance with a very strong smell. Only the male deer produces
      these black pellets, and it drops the small grains on its territory to
      warn other males that this is his home and they should not think to settle
      in the area. The Musk deer grains also serve the purpose of attracting a
      female to his place because as we all know, females go mad for perfumes.
      The female homo-sapiens also love this incredibly attractive perfume and
      for thousands of years, men have been using Musk deer to perfume
      themselves to be more seductive (author intends no harm to communal
      harmony). The Musk grains that are inside the pods are also a remedy for
      very grave diseases known to all antique pharmacopeia. From a population
      of 5,000 in the early 1900s, Hangul’s numbers have constantly declined
      over the decades, According to the latest survey in 2017, the population
      of Hangul is 182 in Dachigam and adjoining areas. Earlier population
      estimates suggest that there were 197 deer in 2004 and 186 in 2015. Now,
      Hangul is largely confined to the 141 square kilometers of Dachigam
      National Park. The biggest challenges which have been identified by
      experts in the way of conservation and population growth of Hangul are
      habitat fragmentation, predation, and a very low fawn-female ratio.
      Another challenge is the male-female and fawn-adult disparity in the
      Hangul population. The decline in Hangul’s population is mainly occurring
      due to the low recruitment rate of fawns to adults. There is a
      female-biased ratio of 23 males to every 100 females. The female-biased
      ratio and the fawn to female ratio of 30:100 are the two main reasons for
      the declining numbers of Kashmir’s Hangul.
