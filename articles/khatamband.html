      <h1>Khatamband: Cieling art in continuous decline</h1>
      Khatamband is the art of making a ceiling, by using pieces of wood and
      fitting them in a geometrical pattern. The whole process is done by hands
      by highly experienced workers. It is speculated that Khatamband was bought
      to Kashmir around the 14th century by the famous saint Shah-i-Hamdan, his
      followers also included Khatamband workers from Iran. These workers taught
      the art to the local artisans. Khatamband got popular due to its beauty
      and characteristic insulative qualities. As Kashmir experiences harsh,
      bitter winters, Khatamband was just the right thing. Later it is believed
      that Mirza Hyder Douglat worked like an ox of a man to spread this art
      throughout Kashmir. It is an expensive art and not many people invested in
      it for a long time, as a matter of fact, the mid-nineties saw the art
      gradually fading away owing to its expensive proposition. Today foreign
      export is the artistsâ€™ biggest hope. There are hundreds of Kashmiri
      artisans, who work outside Kashmir for around four months in different
      states of India, fitting various hotels, malls, houses, etc with
      Khatamband and preserving this national heritage.
