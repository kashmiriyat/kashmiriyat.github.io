      <h1>Jamia Masjid: The masjid in the heart of Kashmir</h1>
      Commissioned by Sultan Sikandar in 1394 and completed 8 years later, in
      1402. Located in central downtown part of Kashmir, and one of the prime
      tourist attractions of Srinagar. Heavily influenced by Persian
      architecture, with a jist of similarities to the Buddhist pagodas<br />
      On the western and eastern sides, the mosque is 381 feet (116 m) in length
      while the northern and southern sides are 384 feet (117 m) long.[11] The
      inner courtyard measures 375 feet (114 m) x 370 feet (110 m) having a 33
      feet (10 m) x 34 feet (10 m) water tank with a fountain flowing in the
      centre. Thus the space area of the Mosque is 146,000 square feet (13,600
      m2). Its walls made of burnt bricks are over 4 feet (1.2 m) thick. The
      lower portion of the walls is made of rectangular stones. There are three
      big entrance gates on north, south and eastern sides of the Mosque
      confronting three turrets standing on lofty columns of deodar wood. The
      eastern side has a large entrance called the Shah Gate which is covered
      with a pyramidal roof surmounted by a square open pavilion (brangh) with a
      spire on top. A total of 378 wooden columns support the roof. Each turret
      is supported by eight lofty pillars 48 feet (15 m) high and 6 feet (1.8 m)
      in girth. The mihrab too has a similar turret over it. The remaining
      interior of the Mosque has 346 columns 21 feet (6.4 m) high and 5 feet
      (1.5 m) in girth. Initially the roof was covered with birch bark and clay.
      The western wall of the cloister has a mihrab made of black Kashmiri
      marble which is adorned with beautiful calligraphic work and has engraved
      on it ninety-nine attributes of Almighty Allah. The Mosque can hold 33,333
      persons besides the Imam at a single prayer congregation. Plaque of Jamia
      Masjid To reach the Mosque roof, the walls of the four turrets have
      interior stairs in the circular form that end in the lounges of each
      turret. The city of Srinagar can be viewed from these high turrets. The
      roof is constructed out of timber and iron bars. The birch bark over the
      roof is now replaced by corrugated iron sheets. The inner courtyard of the
      Mosque has a water fountain, that is used for ablution, with four lawns
      around it decorated with chinar trees. The water tank in the courtyard was
      originally fed by a water channel known as Lachma Kual.
