      <h1>Paper mâché: The exquisite art of Kashmir</h1>
      <h3>
        How a sufi saint bought it to Kashmir and how it became an exquisite
        handicraft
      </h3>
      Papier-mâché is the French word for "chewed paper".Kashmiri papier-mâché
      is a handicraft of Kashmir that was brought by Muslim saint Mir Sayyid Ali
      Hamadani from Persia in the 14th century to medieval India. It is based
      primarily on paper pulp, and is a richly decorated, colourful artifact;
      generally in the form of vases, bowls, or cups (with and without metal
      rims), boxes, trays, bases of lamps, and many other small objects. These
      are made in homes, and workshops, in Srinagar, and other parts of the
      Kashmir Valley, and are marketed primarily within India, although there is
      a significant international market.<br /><br />
      The papier-mâché technique of using paper pulp for making decorative
      objects was first adopted in Kashmir in the 15th century by King
      Zain-ul-Abidin. Mir Sayyed Ali Hamdani, a Sufi mystic, came to Kashmir
      during the late 14th century along with his followers, many of whom were
      craftsmen. These craftsmen used hand-made paper pulp from Iran, Central
      Asia. It is also said that the prince had been imprisoned in Samarkand in
      Central-Asia for many years. The leader of craftsmen, Mir Syed Ali
      Hamdani, a Sufi mystic, also known as Shah-i-Hamdan, was also instrumental
      on converting people in Kashmir to Islam. These artists who were also
      well-versed in other handicrafts such as woodcarving, copper engraving and
      carpet weaving made Kashmir their permanent home. They settled here along
      with their families. Earlier to this period the practice was to draw
      colourful paintings on wood on household furniture such as ceilings,
      bedsteads, doors and windows, palanquins and so forth. Internally this art
      form was called, kar-i-qulamdan as it was made as pen holders and a few
      other personal trinkets. Another term used for the art was kar-i-munaqqash
      as it was crafted on smoothly finished surfaces created using paper pulp
      or on layers of polished paper. Even treated and stretched skin was used
      for the purpose. Starting with decorating jackets of books, the art
      covered many items of that period such as tables, table ware, bangles,
      lamp stands, cups, plaques, panels, screens and cabinets. During the
      Mughal era, its use was extended to include many items of home furniture
      that were made in Kashmir. Many notable objects of this type are exhibited
      in museums in many parts of the world. The basic method followed was to
      apply the papier-mâché on wood work, and one such work can be seen in
      Kashmir at the Madin Sahib Mosque built in 1444, the ceiling of the Shah
      Hamdan Mosque and the Shalimar Garden, a Mughal garden in Srinagar. This
      tradition of using papier-mâché or pulp on wood work to be colourfully
      painted with different designs is very much in practice even today. Some
      of the older designs involved intricate painting of kingfishers, maple
      leaves and other designs, such as "Arabesque", "Yarkand" and "Hazara". To
      encourage this art form to proliferate, the Government of Kashmir has
      included papier-mâché as a curriculum subject in schools.<br /><br />
