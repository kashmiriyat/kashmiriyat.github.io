      For those who’ve never heard of it before, Waguv is an ancient Kashmiri
      craft of mat making which dates back to the 18thcentury. The 300-year-old
      craft involves entwining reed and rice straw together in perfect harmony
      to create a piece of flooring which provides warmth in winters and a
      cooling effect in summers Wading through the unperturbed waters of Dal
      Lake in a battered Shikara, a swampy area that is known to bring forth the
      grass forms required in Waguv making. Weavers in the Dal locality
      laboriously gather their raw material from this half land - half water and
      take them to their own homes where they will be transformed into the
      coziest and most breathtaking mats ever. After the men have collected this
      grass, locally known as “Peich” in their Shikara, the women of the house
      spring into action. Traditionally, it was the women who would actually
      plaid reed into a Wagoo. The mat would sell in the markets at a good cost
      and enable them to be financially independent. The womenfolk essentially
      dry the grass to perfection and tie the reed with small wooden poles
      parallel. They then entwine dried rice straw into the reed verticals and
      tighten them. After a thorough process of this plaiding, tightening, and
      cutting into desired shapes, the Waguv is finally ready to be sent and
      sold in the market. The craft involves an entire family where the males
      are responsible to gather raw material and sell in the marketplace while
      the women are responsible for weaving the reed into mats. The Waguv is not
      just a craft, it is a legacy carried forward by generations altogether.
      There was a time when it was in such a boom that over 500 families only in
      Srinagar area of the Valley were engaged in its making. Out of these 500,
      51 families lived in Akhoon Mohalla alone. Its earthy feel being cozy
      would yield warmth in the winter and bring cool in the summer. These
      weavers were located around the swampy areas of Chak Bagh, Aakhoon
      Mohalla, DalLake, Ganderbal and Aanchar. Such was the glory of the craft
      that people made it a point that their children knew the intricacies of
      their craft right from the early days of their childhood. In certain
      communities, it would be considered shameful if a fellow did not know how
      to weave a Waguv. However, the glorious craft witnessed a sudden downfall
      with the advent of plastic foams, wooden flooring and a change in society.
      With a decline in demand, the waguv makers would barely make Rs 50 per
      day. It wasn’t sufficient to sustain their families and hence they began
      relying on other jobs in order to sustain themselves. Some became
      laborers, some took to carpentry and beyond. <br /><br />
