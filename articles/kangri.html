      <h1>Kangri: The saviour of Kashmiris</h1>
      What Laila was on Majnun’s bosom, so is the Kanger to a Kashmiri.
      Kanger(or kangri) is an earthen pot filled with hot embers woven around
      with wicker. It is usually used by Kashmiris beneath their traditional
      clothing called pheren to help keep the body warm during the chilly winter
      season. It is portable and lightweight, can be ignited with just 250 grams
      of charcoal, and provides a cheap alternative to the modern-day solution
      such as gas Bukharis and air conditioners. It is a Kashmiris best friend
      in winters because it is not unreliable like electricity. To this day
      Kangri remains an enduring emblem of local craft. So how exactly is a
      kangri made? First wicker sticks are harvested (just outskirts of
      Srinagar), then they are boiled to soften their skin, then the skins are
      peeled, the process is followed by drying the wicker sticks, at the same
      time potters make the earthen pot, then talented workers weave a network
      of wicker sticks to make beautiful, eye-catching kangris. But, to the dark
      side of our most loved kangri, regular use can cause a special type of
      skin cancer called kangri cancer! And no, I’m not joking.
